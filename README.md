# Official-WarThunder-Calculator
Final Product of the war thunder calculator. It is a graphical interface that does multiple functions.

This program has similar functions to the Command Line versions, but includes a user interface to manage the calculations.
Suggestions are welcomed and look great if you wish to suggest them

Please fill out any bug reports here with the appropriate tags an include pictures of the errors you encounter. 
At this time there isnt a log file so this isnt necessary when reporting bug reports

At this time this version of the program requires an internet connection to function. This is due to the space saving of the vehicle icon in terms of Data.
At the moment a standalone version that doesnt require the internet is completed, but size prevents upload to github.

The source code will be uploaded to whoever wishes to maintain the database and further update the program in regards to the database.
If people wish to contribute to the core database, I will be working on a long term solution. At this time it is unavailable unless in local form

Please report any bugs on github as they are linked to my email and I see the request immediatly.
